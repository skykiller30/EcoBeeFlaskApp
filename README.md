# Collecting Temperature Readings from Multiple Devices
The purpose of the project is to collect temperature data from multiple applications across my house and place them all on 1 local dashboard

Temperature Data will be collected from
- Google
- EcoBee
- PhilipsHue

Each data source has its own method of collecting temperature data see the wiki on how to set up developer accounts for each vendor
